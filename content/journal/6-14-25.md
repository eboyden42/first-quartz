What I did today.

 Hello?

Today is one of my days off.

Not three days ago I was at the end of my 91 hour weeks, leetcode from 6:45-7:45 am work from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. And work for my unpaid internship from 7:00-9:00 pm. Between food prep, laundry and showers I had basically zero time. And I was constantly exhausted.

Now I get to take things at a much better pace. I woke up around 7:20 am, and got to work on leetcode from 7:30-8:30 am. From 8:30-9:30 am I updated my resume, submitted an internship application to Abbott for a summer internship 2026, and set up a service with a paid professional resume optimizer. Then from 9:30 am to 12:00 I worked on my internship, updating the navbar to have better accessibility.
Then I made and ate lunch and took a short break. I then played a chess game, lost, and began learning about quartz and obsidian. I skimmed through the quartz docs and made sure that I understood the idea of the service. I then followed a short tutorial to set up a Quartz through VSCode.

Now I'm learning how to use Obsidian and I decided to write a journal entry to use later as I learn how this all fits together.

Good news is I have plenty of more time to work on this today, and I'm sure I can make some good progress if I'm thorough.
