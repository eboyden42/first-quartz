> [!problem] Expectation of Poisson
> Show how to derive these results from the PDF of a Poisson variable $X\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\lambda)$:
> - (a) $E[X]=\lambda$
> - (b) $\mathrm{Var}[X]=\lambda$

> [!problem] $\bigstar$ Expectation directly from CDF
> Suppose $X$ is a continuous random variable. Show that: 
> $$
> E[X] = \int_0^\infty \big(1-F_X(t)\big)\,dt - \int_{-\infty}^0 F_X(t)\,dt.
> $$
> Start with the RHS. Reduce each summand to a double integral involving the PDF in terms of $x$. Change order of integration. Perform the $t$ integral. Combine terms.
