> [!problem] Insurance risk groups
> An insurance company divides customers into three risk categories: High (H), Medium (M), and Low (L). Assume the following distribution of customers: 70\% are High risks, 20\% are Medium risks, and $10 \%$ are Low risks. The probabilities of a customer filing an accident claim (C) are: $2.5 \%$ for High, $1 \%$ for Medium, and $0.5 \%$ for Low. A customer is chosen at random.
> 
> (a) What is the probability that the customer files a claim?
> 
> (b) If a customer has filed a claim, what is the probability that the customer was in the High risk category?

> [!problem] Passing the exam
> An exam has 3 sections. The first section has 2 problems, the second section has 3 problems, and the third section has 4 problems.
> 
> To pass a section, you must solve at least 1 problem in that section. You need to pass all 3 sections to pass the exam.
> 
> The probability of solving any one problem is 0.75. The problems are not related.

> [!problem] QC Inspector
> A lot containing 10 components is sampled by a quality control inspector. The lot contains 7 good components and 3 defective components. A random sample of 2 is taken (without replacement) by the inspector. Let X represent the number of good components in the inspector's sample.

> [!problem] Doctorâ€™s visits
> I am supposed to visit my doctor once every four months to get my blood pressure checked. However, I have a hard time sticking to the schedule, and as a result, rarely do I visit my doctor three times a year. The function below is the CDF of X, the number of my visits in a year.

> 0.53 & 1 \leq x<2 \\
> 0.97 & 2 \leq x<3 \\
> 1 & x \geq 3\end{cases}

> 
> (a) Find the probability that I will visit my doctor more than once in a year.
> 
> (b) Find the number of times I expect to visit my doctor in a typical year.

> [!problem] Potholes
> There are a lot of small potholes on the US-1N between Conowingo, MD and Concordville, PA, and once or twice a month, Deep drives this stretch on my way to Philadelphia from Charlottesville. He has realized that this situation (potholes on the highway) can be modeled by a Poisson process, and that if the RV $X$ denotes the distance between successive potholes (measured in miles), then the CDF of $X$ is:

> F_X(x)=\begin{cases}1-e^{-0.5 x} & x \geq 0 \\
