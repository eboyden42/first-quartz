## Conditional probability
#### 01
> [!problem] Conditional probability - algebra games
> Assume that $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ partition the sample space, and assume this data: 
> 
> | $P[A_1]$ | $P[A_2]$ | $P[A_3]$ | $P[B\mid A_1]$ | $P[B\mid A_2]$ | $P[B\mid A_3]$ |
> |:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
> |  $30\%$  |  $40\%$  |  $30\%$  |     $50\%$     |     $50\%$     |     $60\%$     |
> Find these values:
> - $P[B]$
> - $P[A_1\mid B]$
> - $P[A_2\mid B]$
> - $P[A_3\mid B]$
#### 02
> [!problem] Conditioning relation
> Suppose you know $P[A\cap B]=0.036$ and $P[A\mid B]=0.18$ and $P[B\mid A]=0.60$.
> 
> Calculate $P[A]$ and $P[B]$ and $P[A\cup B]$. ^ghso6h
#### 03
> [!problem] Interpreting Multiplication - Fund performance
> The odds of the Winning Fund outperforming the market in a random year are 15%. The odds that it outperforms the market in a 1-year period assuming it has done so in the prior year are 30%.
> 
> What is the probability of the Winning Fund outperforming the market in 2 consecutive years?

## Bayes’ Theorem
#### 04
> [!problem] Bayes’ Theorem - Stolen computer
> Someone in a coffee shop “promises” to watch your computer while you’re in the bathroom.
> 
> If she does watch it, the probability that it gets stolen is 10%.
> If she doesn’t watch it, the probability that it gets stolen is 70%.
> You think there’s a 90% chance she is honest enough to watch it, having promised.
> 
> When you come back from the bathroom, the computer is gone.
> What is the probability that she witnessed the theft?
#### 05
> [!problem] Bayes’ Theorem - Inferring die from roll
> A bag contains one 4-sided die, one 6-sided die, and one 12-sided die. You draw a random die from the bag, roll it, and get a 4.
> 
> What is the probability that you drew the 6-sided die? ^7hqntq
#### 06
> [!problem] Bayes’ Theorem - DNA evidence
> A crime is committed in a town of 100,000 citizens. After all 100,000 citizens’ DNA is analyzed, your friend Jim is found to have a DNA match to evidence at the scene. A forensics expert says that the probability of a random person matching this evidence is 0.01%. How likely is it that Jim is guilty? ^tiimo4

## Independence
#### 07
> [!problem] Independence puzzle
> Assume $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ are mutually independent. Compute $P[A_1 A_2\cup A_3]$ in terms of $P[A_1]$, $P[A_2]$, and $P[A_3]$.
#### 08
> [!problem] Pairwise independent, not mutually independent: three coin flips
> Flip a coin three times in sequence. Label events like this:
> - $A$ - exactly one heads among first and second flips
> - $B$ - exactly one heads among second and third flips
> - $C$ - exactly one heads among first and third flips
> 
> Verify that $A,\,B,\,C$ are *pairwise* independent but not actually *mutually* independent.

## Tree diagrams
#### 09
> [!problem] Bin of marbles
> A bin contains 5 red marbles, 7 blue marbles, and 3 white marbles.
> 
> We draw a random marble. If it’s red, we put it back, if it’s not red, we keep it. We do this three times.
> 
> (a) What is the probability of getting red then white then blue?
> 
> (b) Suppose the last draw was blue. What is the probability that the first was red? ^twln5q

## Counting
#### 10
> [!problem] Counting outcomes - permutations and combinations
> In a lottery, five distinct numbers are picked at random from $1,2,3,\dots,40$. How many possible outcomes are there: 
> 
> (a) If we care about the order of numbers.
> 
> (b) If the order does not matter. ^janw1i
#### 11
> [!problem] Wisconsin flag 2 of 3 days
> A kindergarten class hangs a random state flag (50 flags) on the wall every day. What is the probability that two days out of three given days have Wisconsin’s flag?
#### 12
> [!problem] Drawing balls of distinct color
> A bin contains 3 green and 4 yellow balls. Two balls are drawn out.
> 
> What is the probability that they are different colors?
