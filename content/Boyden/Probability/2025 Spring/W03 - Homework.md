## Counting
#### 01
> [!problem] Rolling two dice
> Two dice are rolled. Find the probabilities of the following events:
> - $A$, the event that the sum is 10
> - $B$, the event that the sum is 12
> - $C$, the event that the two numbers are equal
#### 02
> [!problem] Binomial - Repeated coin flips
> A coin is flipped 7 times and the sequence of results recorded as an outcome.
> 
> (a) How many possible outcomes have exactly 3 heads?
> 
> (b) How many possible outcomes have at least 3 heads?
#### 03
> [!problem] Multinomial - Colored marbles in a line
> How many ways are there to line up 10 colored marbles (2 red, 3 white, 5 blue), assuming you cannot distinguish marbles of the same color? ^3kqkpy
#### 04
> [!problem] Multinomial - Many rolls of a die
> Roll a die 100 times.
> 
> (a) What is the probability that you rolled exactly 16 ones and 17 twos? (No need to simplify your answer.) Hint: use three bins. What are the bins?
> 
> (b) Using summation notation, write down a formula for the probability of rolling exactly 25 ones and *at least* 50 twos.
> 
> For this problem, use “desired outcomes over total outcomes” (simple counting), not repeated trials theory (next section).

## Repeated trials
#### 05
> [!problem] Independent trials - At least 45 good paper clips
> For a paper clip production line, 90% of the paper clips come off good, and 10% come off broken.
> 
> You buy a box of 50 paper clips from this line. What is the probability that at least 45 of them are good? ^888b72
#### 06
> [!problem] Geometric wait time - Takes 10 rolls to get 6
> A fair die is rolled until a six comes up. What are the odds that it takes at least 10 rolls?
> 
> Hint: you might find it easier to compute the odds of the complementary event.
#### 07
> [!problem] Intersection accidents
> Suppose that the odds of an accident occurring on any given day at the intersection of Ivy and Emmet is 0.05.
> 
> (a) What are the odds of a perfect week? (No accidents.)
> 
> (b) What are the odds of exactly 2 accidents in 30 days?
> 
> (c) What are the odds of the first accident occurring after day 4 and by day 10?
#### 08
> [!problem] Guessing on a test
> Your odds of getting any given exam question right are $80\%$. The exam has 4 questions, and you need to answer 3 correctly to pass.
> 
> (a) What is the probability that you pass?
> 
> (b) After finishing the exam, you are 100% sure that you got the second question right. Now what are the odds that you pass? ^tajmq5

## Reliability

#### 09
> [!problem] Reliability for complex process
> Consider a process with the following diagram of components in series and parallel:
> ![350](Pasted%20image%2020250126144944.png)
> 
> Use $W_i$ to denote the event that component $i$ succeeds.
> 
> Suppose the success probabilities per component are given by this chart:
> 
> |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
> | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
> | 80% | 60% | 40% | 90% | 80% | 50% | 70% | 90% |
> What are the odds of success for the whole process? ^u81sr3

## Discrete random variables
#### 10
> [!problem] Digit of a real number
> Suppose a real number is chosen randomly in the unit interval $[0,1]$. Consider the decimal expansion of this number. Let $Y$ be a random variable giving the first digit after the decimal point. Find the possible values, the PMF, and the CDF of $Y$.
#### 11
> [!problem] Gambling with a coin
> Two players, A and B, are flipping a fair coin together. If it comes up heads, A pays \$1 to B, and if it comes up tails, B pays \$1 to A.
> 
> They play five rounds. Let $X$ be a random variable recording A’s final winnings.
> 
> (a) Describe the set of possible values of $X$.
> 
> (b) Describe the PMF and CDF of $X$.
