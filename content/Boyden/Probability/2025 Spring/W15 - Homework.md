MMSE linear estimator from joint density
In HW 10-07, you studied this joint PDF: 

$$f_{X, Y}(x, y)= \begin{cases}\frac{3}{2}\left(x^2+y^2\right) & x,y\in [0,1] \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}$$

What is the minimal MSE linear estimator for $X$ in terms of $Y$?

What is the linear estimate of $X$ given $Y=0.7$?

(You may use the data you found in HW 10-07, you donâ€™t need to repeat those calculations.)

%% 
A telemetry signal, $T$, transmitted from a temperature sensor on a communications satellite is a Gaussian random variable with $E [T]=0$ and $\operatorname{Var}[T]=9$. The receiver at mission control receives $R=T+X$, where $X$ is a noise voltage independent of $T$ with PDF

$$
f_X(x)= \begin{cases}1 / 6 & -3 \leq x \leq 3 \\ 0 & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$

The receiver uses $R$ to calculate a linear estimate of the telemetry voltage:

$$
\hat{t}_L(r)=a r+b
$$

(a) What is $E [R]$, the expected value of the received voltage?
(b) What is $\operatorname{Var}[R]$, the variance of the received voltage?
(c) What is $\operatorname{Cov}[T, R]$, the covariance of the transmitted voltage and the received voltage?
(d) What is the correlation coefficient $\rho_{T, R}$ of $T$ and $R$ ?
(e) What are $a^*$ and $b^*$, the optimum mean square values of $a$ and $b$ in the linear estimator?
(f) What is $e_L^*$, the minimum mean square error of the linear estimate?
