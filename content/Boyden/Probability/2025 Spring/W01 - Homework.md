## Events and outcomes
#### 01
> [!problem] Sample space - roll a die, flip a coin
> A normal 6-sided die is cast, and then a coin is flipped. All results are recorded.
> 
> - (a) Define a sample space for this experiment.
> - (b) How many possible *events* are there?
#### 02
> [!problem] Sample space - roll a die then flip coin(s)
> A normal 6-sided die is cast. If the result is even, flip a coin two times; if the result is odd, flip a coin one time. All results are recorded.
> 
> - (a) Define a sample space for this experiment.
> - (b) How many possible *events* are there?
#### 03
> [!problem] Events - descriptions to sets
> You are modeling quality assurance for cars coming off an assembly line. They are either good (G) or broken (B). You watch 4 cars come off and record their status as a sequence of these letters, for example ‘GGBG’.
> 
> Determine the *sets* defined by the events having the following descriptions:
> - (a) “third car is broken”
> - (b) “all cars have the same status”
> - (c) “at least one car is broken”
> - (d) “no consecutive cars have the same status”

## Probability models
#### 04
> [!problem] Venn diagrams - set rules and Kolmogorov additivity
> Suppose we know three probabilities of events: $P[A]=0.4$, $P[B]=0.3$, and $P[A\cap B]=0.1$.
> 
> Calculate: $P[A\cup B]$, $P[A^c]$, $P[B^c]$, $P[A\cap B^c]$, and $P[(A\cap B)^c]$. ^whsizj
#### 05
> [!problem] Inclusion-exclusion reasoning
> Your friend says: “according to my calculations, the probability of $A$ is $0.5$ and the probability of $B$ is $0.7$, but the probability of $A$ and $B$ both happening is only $0.001$.”
> 
> You tell your friend they don’t understand probability. Why? ^hj2jng
#### 06
> [!problem] Inclusion-exclusion reasoning
> Suppose $P(A)=0.4$ and $P(B)=0.7$. Show that $0.1\leq P(AB)\leq 0.4$.
#### 07
> [!problem] At least two heads from three flips
> A coin is flipped three times.
> 
> What is the probability that at least two heads appear? ^30iw2f

## Conditional probability
#### 08
> [!problem] Conditioning - restrict to 4th-year students
> Student test-passing rates, by year: 
> 
> |      | 1st year | 2nd year | 3rd year | 4th year |
> | ---- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
> | Pass | 0.155    | 0.340    | 0.255    | 0.160    |
> | Fail | 0.025    | 0.040    | 0.015    | 0.010    |
> What is the likelihood that a randomly chosen 4th-year student passed the test?
> What about for 1st-year students?
#### 09
> [!problem] Conditioning - two dice, at least one is 5
> Two dice are rolled, and at least one is a 5.
> 
> What is the probability that their sum is 10? ^8w9yqj
#### 10
> [!problem] Conditioning - two dice, differing numbers
> Two dice are rolled, and the outcomes are different.
> 
> What is the probability of getting at least one 1?
#### 11
> [!problem] Multiplication - drawing two hearts
> Two cards are drawn from a standard deck (without replacement).
> 
> (a) What is the probability that both are hearts?
> 
> (b) What is the probability that both are 4? ^52sbgp
