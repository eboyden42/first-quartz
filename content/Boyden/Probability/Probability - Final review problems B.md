> [!problem] Body weights
> Assume that body weights of men are Normally distributed with a mean of 170 pounds and a standard deviation of 30 pounds.
> 
> What is the body weight threshold separating the lightest 90% from the heaviest 10%?

> [!problem] Potholes spacing
> The distance ($X$, measured in miles) between successive potholes on a highway follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda=1$ per mile.
> 
> For a research project, a civil engineer is interested in learning more about the square roots of the distances between successive potholes. What is the PDF of $Y=\sqrt{X}$?

> [!problem] Series of games, joint PMF
> Two teams, A and B, will play a series of up to 3 games. The series ends when either team wins 2 games, so there are only 2 games if either team wins the first two games. A game can't end in a tie. The outcomes of the games are independent of each other.
> 
> The probability of team A winning any game is 0.6.
> 
> Let X denote the total number of games in the series. Let Y denote the number of games won by team A .
> 
> (a) Construct the joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$.
> 
> (b) Given that 3 games were played, find the minimum mean square error estimate of the number of games won by A.

> [!problem] Comparator circuit
> I have designed a comparator circuit with a multiplexer that chooses the smaller of two inputs $X$ and $Y$.
> 
> Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are independent uniform continuous random variables with range $(0,1)$.
> 
> Find the PDF of the output $W$. (Include bounds for $W$.)

> [!problem] Adder circuit
> I have designed an analog adder circuit that adds two inputs $X$ and $Y$. So the output is $W = X + Y$. Assume $X$ and $Y$ are independent uniform continuous random variables with range $(0,1)$.

> Find the CDF of the output $W$.

> [!problem] Community college ages
> At a community college, the mean age of the students is 22.3 years, and the standard deviation is 4 years. A random sample of 64 students is drawn.
> 
> (a) What is the probability that the average age of the students in the random sample is less than 23 years?
> 
> (b) Use Markov's Inequality to find an upper bound for the probability that the average age of the students in the random sample is more than 23 years.
> 
> (c) What is the probability that the total age of the students in the random sample is less than 1472 years?

 > [!problem] Doorbell system
 > An automatic doorbell system rings a bell whenever it detects someone by the door. The system uses a photodetector. If no one is present (null hypothesis), the photodetector output N is a Poisson RV with expected value $2500$ photons. Otherwise, when a person is present (second hypothesis), the photodetector output is a Poisson RV with expected value 3000 photons.
 > 
 > Assume 50% prior probability that someone is outside the door.
 > 
 > Design a binary hypothesis test to determine whether someone is outside the door. Clearly identify the two acceptance sets as a function of the number of photons.

> [!problem] Telemetry
> A telemetry signal $X$ transmitted from a temperature sensor on a communications satellite is a random variable with $E[X]=0$ and $\mathrm{Var}[X]=4$.
> 
> The receiver at mission control receives the signal $Y=X+N$, where $N$ is a noise voltage that is independent of $X$ and has this PDF: 
> 
> $$f_N(n)=\begin{cases}0.25 & -2 \leq n \leq 2 \\
> 0 & \text {otherwise}\end{cases}$$
