### Arc length
#### 03
> [!problem] Arc length - tricky algebra
> Find the arc length of the curve $y=\frac{x^4}{8}+\frac{1}{4x^2}$ for $x\in[1,2]$.
> 
> (Hint: expand under the root, then simplify, then factor; now it’s a square and the root disappears.)
#### 04
> [!problem] Arc length - tricky integration
> Find the arc length of the curve $y=e^x$ for $x\in[0,1/2]$.
> 
> (Hint: the integral can be done using either: (i) $u$-sub then trig sub, or (ii) ‘rationalization’ then partial fractions.)

### Surface areas of revolutions - thin bands
#### 05
> [!problem] Surface area: cone
> A *cone* may be described as the surface of revolution of a ray emanating from the origin, revolved around the $x$-axis.
> 
> Let $f(x)=mx$ for some $m>0$. Find the surface area of the cone given by revolving the graph of $f$ around the *$x$-axis* over $x\in[0,h]$.
> 
> Can you also calculate this area using geometry? And verify the two methods give the same formula? (Hint: ‘unroll’ the cone into a sector.)
#### 06
> [!problem] Surface area: parabolic reflector
> A parabolic reflector is given by rotating the curve $y=x^2$ around the *$y$-axis* for $x\in[0,2]$.
> 
> What is the surface area of this reflector? ^833tp2
#### 07
> [!problem] Surface area: torus
> A torus is created by revolving about the *$x$-axis* the circle with this equation: $$x^2+(y-b)^2=a^2$$
> 
> Find the surface area of this torus.
> ![150](Pasted%20image%2020240919092119.png)
> 
> (Hint: compute for the top and bottom of the circle separately and add the results.)
