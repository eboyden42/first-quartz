#### 01
> [!problem] Fluid force on a triangular plate
> Find the total force on the submerged vertical plate that is an isosceles triangle with base $1\mathrm{m}$ and height $2\mathrm{m}$, and assume it is submerged with the upper vertex $3\mathrm{m}$ below the surface. Liquid is oil with density $\rho=900\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.

### Moments and CoM
#### 02
> [!problem] Center of mass of a house
> A “house” is the region bounded by the (non-regular) pentagon with vertex points at $(0,5)$, $(2,3)$, $(2,0)$, $(-2,0)$, $(-2,3)$. Find the CoM of the house using additivity of moments.

### Hydrostatic pressure
#### 04
> [!problem] Fluid force on a parabolic plate
> A parabolic plate is submerged vertically in water as in the figure:
> ![300](Pasted%20image%2020240924222443.png)
> 
> The shape of the plate is bounded below by $y=x^2$ and above by the line $y=1$. (Note that $y$ *increases going up* in this coordinate system.)
> 
> Compute the total fluid force on this plate.
> 
> (Hint: your integrand should contain $(1-y)$ as a factor.)
#### 05
> [!problem] Fluid force on various plates
> For diagrams (a)-(i) below, set up an integral to compute the hydrostatic force on the plate.

#### 07
> [!problem] CoM from Simpson’s
> Use Simpson’s rule (with 6 subintervals) to estimate the centroid of this region:
