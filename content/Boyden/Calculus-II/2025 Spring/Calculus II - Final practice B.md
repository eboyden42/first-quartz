1\. Using the method of shells, find the volumes of the solids given by revolving the regions:
- (a) The region enclosed between $-x^2+5x$ and $x^2-5x+8$. Rotate about the $y$-axis.
- (b) The region under the curve $y=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$ for $1\leq x\leq 2$. Rotate about the line $x=-2$.

3\.  Consider the curve $y=x^2$ on $0\leq x\leq 1$.
- (a) Set up an integral that computes the arc length of this curve.
- (b) Revolve this curve about the $x$-axis. Set up an integral for the surface area of the revolution.

4\. Set up the integrals that give the hydrostatic force on these shapes:

5\. Find the CoMs of the regions:
(a) Area under the curve $y=\cos x$ for $0\leq x\leq \frac{\pi}{2}$. $\quad$ (b) See figure:

7\. Set up an integral that computes the work done (against gravity) to build a circular cone-shaped tower of height $4\mathrm{m}$ and base radius $1.2\mathrm{m}$ out of a material with mass density $600\,\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^3$.

8\. Use Simpsonâ€™s Rule with $n=6$ to approximate the area of the pictured region:
