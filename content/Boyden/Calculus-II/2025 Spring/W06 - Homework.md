#### 01
> [!problem] Pumping water from hemispherical tank
> A hemispherical tank (radius $10\mathrm{m}$) is full of water. A pipe allows water to be pumped out, but requires pumping up $2\mathrm{m}$ above the top of the tank.
> ![200](Pasted%20image%2020240930215036.png)
> 
> - (a) Set up an integral that computes the total work required to pump all the water out of the tank, assuming it is completely full.
> - (b) Now assume the tank start out full just to $6\mathrm{m}$. What does the integral become? ^6bftz2
#### 02

### Work performed
#### 04
> [!problem] Work to raise a leaky bucket
> A bucket of water is raised by a chain to the top of a $50$-foot building. The water is leaking out, and the chain is getting lighter.
> 
> The bucket weighs $4\,\mathrm{lbs}$, the initial water weighs $30\,\mathrm{lbs}$, and the chain weighs $0.25\,\mathrm{lb/ft}$, and the water is leaking at a rate of $0.3\,\mathrm{lbs/sec}$ as the bucket is lifted at a rate of $3\,\mathrm{ft/sec}$.

> [!problem] Work to pump water from cylindrical tank
> A cylindrical tank is full of water and the water is pumped out the top. (See figure.) The length of the tank is $7\mathrm{m}$ and the radius is $5\mathrm{m}$.
