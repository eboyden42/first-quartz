### xx Theory

One final type of power product has a different nature. It is important for the topic of *Fourier series* (in ODE) so we study it. Here the *frequency* varies, while the power is always $1$.

For example, consider: $$\int \sin 4x\cdot\cos 5x\,dx$$
This type of integrand may be converted to a sum of single-factor trig functions using these identities, which are created by solving the angle-sum and angle-difference formulas for the desired product: 
- $\sin A\,\cos B = \frac{1}{2}\big(\sin(A-B)+\sin(A+B)\big)$
- $\sin A\,\sin B = \frac{1}{2}\big(\cos(A-B)-\cos(A+B)\big)$
- $\cos A\,\cos B = \frac{1}{2}\big(\cos(A-B)+\cos(A+B)\big)$

Note:
- ! These should be *rederived*, when needed, from the sum and difference trig identities.
